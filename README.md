This repository contains the data and analysis scripts supporting the findings in the pre-print Fabrication, characterization and mechanical loading of Si/SiGe membranes for spin qubit devices by L. Marcogliese et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14589). The corresponding Zenodo DOI is 10.5281/zenodo.17452954. 

The figures (X = [1,6]) can be firectly reproduced with the Jupyter Notebooks FigX.
Raw data (ellipsometry, AFM, profilometry, microscopy) and simulation results (finite element and Kirchoff-Love plate theory) can be found under "Raw_data" and "Simulation_data".

Fits to ellipsometric data can be reproduced with ellipsometry_tmm_model.ipynb which relies on the complex refractive indices in the "Material_parameters" directory. 

The repository can be ran with BinderHub using the following link: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lumarcogliese/Data-Availability---Si-SiGe-Membranes/9799af09dfd9990a9f2cbe9a51913afda8128ecd?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FFig1.ipynb
